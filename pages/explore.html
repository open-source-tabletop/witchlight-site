<p>In ancient days, while humans still roamed the world, hunting and gathering in small tribes, there existed a mirror realm, a veiled world known as the Umbra. Ruled by an enigmatic fae race, the Eldren, the Umbra was a vibrant tapestry of boundless magic and untamed beauty. As the tribes of humanity learned to settle their world, to harness it, to build small camps and farm the land, the Eldren lived in harmony with the natural forces of their world. And yet it was the Eldren who would suffer a great cataclysm, destroying them utterly, leaving their world abandoned and feral, a land where the wilds encroach and ancient secrets slumber beneath layers of moss and shadow.</p>

<p>When the cataclysm of the Eldren struck, it awakened something primal and powerful within humanity, and the Umbra called to those who could hear its haunting song. Only a few women among all the tribes of humanity felt this pull, branded as witches, gifted and cursed with incredible power. Each witch is a vessel of the world's innate magic, her craft a unique thread in the grand weave of the arcane. Drawn to the Umbra by visions of power and whispers of lost knowledge, seeking hidden paths in the veil between worlds, they come to forge their destinies in this untamed wilderness. The intense magic within the Umbra grants witches longevity and power, but it tears at their sanity, forcing them to retreat back to the mortal world.</p>

<p>The Umbra is a land of contrasts, its regions as diverse as the witches who wander its paths. In the dense, mist-laden forests, ancient trees tower, their roots gripping secrets as old as the world itself. Vast moors stretch beneath brooding skies, where the spirits of the past linger in the fog. Ruined fae cities carved from the rocks of mountains, now eroded by wild magic, stand as silent witnesses to the glory and downfall of the Eldren. Each region harbors its own mysteries and dangers, a reflection of the wild and varied nature of the Umbra.</p>

<p>In this land of twilight and shadow, witches form circles, bands of loyalty and war, drawing into their service creatures both mundane and fantastical. These warbands clash amidst the ruins of Eldren hubris and in the depths of ancient forests, vying for places of powerâ€”rare nodes where magic is strongest. The struggle for these precious sites is relentless, for in the Umbra, trust is a rare commodity and alliances are often fleeting.</p>

<p>It is a world of dark enchantment and ancient dread, where the line between hunter and hunted is blurred. The witches, in their quest for dominion, must navigate a landscape where danger is a constant companion and trust is a rare and precious asset, their biggest threat coming from other witches. Theirs is a story written in blood and magic, a testament to the relentless pursuit of power in a world where only the cunning and the strong endure.</p>
