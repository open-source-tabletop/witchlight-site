> Step into the mystical world of Witchlight, a new tabletop miniatures game in development from Renegade Minis.

### A World of Witches

In Witchlight you will create a witch, a wielder of ancient magic, as you seek to grow your power and learn the secrets of the lost fae race. The world of Tyranach is ancient, humanity is little more than a fledgling race still living in tribes, only just beginning their journey towards civilisation - and within this world the power of witches is unmatched. However, their power is also a curse, corrupting and destroying the people and land around them, and withering their bodies, causing witches to live outcast, feared by most and hated by all. The only way for a witch to survive is to journey from the mortal world, through the veil into a decaying magical realm where they can draw upon the wild energies there to restore and empower them.

### The Umbra

To mortals, the world is everything they can see, hear, or touch, but witches have long known that there are two halves to Tyranach, the Firma and the Umbra. The Firma, also known as the mortal realm, is the birth place of humans - it is shaped by nature, the elements, and the constant cycle of life and death. Beyond the physical lies another realm, called the Umbra or fae realm, it is a place of raw magic, of power, and the shifting tides of emotion - and the site of some unknown calamity.

It is obvious to those that visit the Umbra that it was once home to another race, believed to be the Eldren, or fae people, from ancient stories. There are many signs of this lost people, their civilisation carved into the bare rock, great standing stones, arches, bridges, and gathering places. That the magic in the Umbra has grown so wild that spending much time their can drive a person beyond their wits may have had something to do with their disappearance, or perhaps it has simply grown wild in their absence.

### The Game

Witchlight will use 32mm miniatures, requiring around a dozen models per player, and a 3 foot by 3 foot space to play. A range of miniatures are being designed for the game that will let you create a Witch and a warband in any style you can imagine. Witchlight invites you to explore a new world, and to find your own unique craft. Whether you're summoning ancient spirits or commanding elemental forces, each decision shapes your personal adventure. Discover a game that celebrates creativity and diversity, offering a rich and immersive experience for all.
