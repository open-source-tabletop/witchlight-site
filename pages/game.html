<blockquote><p>Step into the mystical world of Witchlight, a new tabletop miniatures game in development from Renegade Minis.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Witchlight you will bring to life your own powerful witch, then embark through the Veil into the Umbra to learn forbidden knowledge and grow your power. Craft your spells and abilities, and gather a diverse array of servants and creatures to aid you in thrilling battles.</p>
    
<p>The game will use 32mm miniatures, requiring around a dozen models per player, and a 3 foot by 3 foot space to play. A range of 3D printable miniatures is being designed for the game but you will also be able to use many existing miniatures to represent your Witch and her servants. More details about the game and the rules will be revealed in the coming months.</p>

<p>Witchlight invites you to explore new horizons, where every player can find their unique path. Whether you're summoning ancient spirits or commanding elemental forces, each decision shapes your personal adventure. Discover a game that celebrates creativity and diversity, offering a rich and immersive experience for all.</p>
