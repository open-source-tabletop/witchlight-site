<p>My sketchbook is where I plan ideas, decide what I want things to look like, and explore things much faster than I can using Blender. When I started this project I didn't consider myself an "actual" artist because I had only ever really dipped my toe into drawing. Since starting Witchlight my interest has grown and I think my skill is growing too - and I'd really like to share both my progress and behind the scenes on what I think will be an incredible tabletop game.</p><p>- Callie (June 2024)</p>
