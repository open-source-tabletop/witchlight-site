The Wraithmoor is desolate expanse of moors and bogs within the Umbra, remnants of a once-lush forest now reduced to gnarled, leafless trees slowly decaying amidst the fetid water and thick mist. Mounds rise from the marshy ground, adorned with ancient stones marking what might have been burial sites in ages past.

For witches drawn to the mysteries of the Umbra, The Wraithmoor holds a grim fascination. Amidst the eerie silence and spectral fog, remnants of ancient rituals and potent magical herbs await discovery. Yet, the moors conceal treacherous bogs and malevolent spirits, lingering remnants of a forgotten era, ready to ensnare those who seek the secrets of this haunted realm.
