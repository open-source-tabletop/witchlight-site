The Shadowed Ravines are a labyrinthine expanse within the Umbra, where the earth has been torn asunder into deep, winding fissures. These rugged chasms crisscross the landscape, creating a treacherous maze that stretches far and wide beneath the canopy of ancient, shadowy trees growing on the plateaus above. Within the depths of the Shadowed Ravines, the air is heavy with an eerie stillness, the darkness punctuated only by the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi and the distant echoes of forgotten whispers.

Venturing into the Shadowed Ravines offers both risk and reward. It is an area rich with symbols carved by the Eldren directly into the rock walls, hidden amidst the twisted passages and shadowed recesses. Witches may find scrying pools with which to divine their future, lodestones infused with raw magic, and even the forbidden secrets of the Eldren marked in stone. However, the ravines are also home to malign shadows, creatures that blend perfectly into the gloomy landscape, ready to devour any that cross their path.
