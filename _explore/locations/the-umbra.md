The Umbra, once the domain of the [Eldren](/explore/mythology/the-eldren/), is a realm of raw and untamed magic. With the disappearance of that Fae race it now stands wild and decaying, its mysteries shrouded in the mists of time, a realm of peril and potential.

The once-vibrant magic, now unleashed and uncontrolled, has given rise to dangerous creatures and unpredictable phenomena. The boundary between the Umbra and the mortal realm is marked by a thin veil, in places worn down by time and circumstance. Those with a connection to magic can pass through these weakened points, traversing between realms with cautious reverence for the power that surrounds them.

For mortals, the Umbra is both alluring and treacherousâ€”a place where the rules of reality bend and every step can lead to discovery or demise. Its allure lies in the promise of ancient knowledge and unimaginable power, tempered by the ever-present threat of being driven mad by the wild magic that defines its existence.
