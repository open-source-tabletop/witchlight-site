The Eldren, known to some as the Fae, were an ancient and inscrutable race that once thrived in a realm called the [Umbra](/explore/locations/the-umbra.html). Unlike human civilizations, the Eldren did not construct buildings; their existence was interwoven with the very fabric of the magical world. Their mastery of magic was unparalleled, and their civilization flourished in harmony with the natural forces of the Umbra.

However, the Eldren are now gone, their presence faded into myth and legend. The circumstances of their disappearance remain shrouded in mystery, with only hints of a dark calamity that led to their downfall. Some believe that a cataclysmic force or an internal strife of unimaginable magnitude brought an end to their era.

Today, the Umbra has become a wild and decaying realm, a stark contrast to its once vibrant and thriving state. Though the Eldren are no longer present, the Umbra is still imbued with raw, untamed power. The remnants of their magic linger, making the realm a place of both peril and potential. Witches who venture into the Umbra must tread carefully, for the echoes of the Eldren's fate serve as a grim reminder of the volatile nature of unchecked magic. Moreover, a phenomenon known as the Withering begins to tear at the mind of any witch who lingers too long, forcing them to leave before it drives them mad.
