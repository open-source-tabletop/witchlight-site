description: "Elaris, an ethereal figure of ancient tales, beckons young witches with veiled promises of guidance for their tempestuous craft, her motivations shrouded in inscrutable purpose."
---

Elaris is an ancient figure present across most of human tribal culture, known by many names within many fragmented stories. Some see her as a benevolent spirit that brought rain during droughts, cured diseased crops to prevent famine, or even breaking storms that threatened to wash away entire villages. Others recall that whatever gifts she might bestow always came with a steep cost-she might save a tribe only to demand they leave an area entirely, or require the daughter of a chief to accompany her into the wild lands. Many believe that Elaris was the first true witch, in a time before [Morvaen](/explore/mythology/morvaen/), before humans had truly learned to fear those with power.

For witches, the story of Elaris is not bound to the past: though rarely seen, she is known to still walk between worlds. Shunning mortal humans she is known to appear, dreamlike and beautiful, before young witches grappling with a tempestuous connection to their craft. There are many witches who can claim to have had such an encounter and each hint, again, at a cost almost too high to pay. Whatever Elaris demands will change the witch, guiding her into the full manifestation of her power, but usually deeply scarring her in the process, cutting her from her ties to her mortal kin, and creating a lifelong mistrust of other witches.

Her motivations remain an enigma, woven with threads of inscrutable purpose. Some say she is driven by an insatiable thirst for arcane wisdom and the relentless pursuit of unearthly power, perhaps more a reflection of their own deepest desires than any purpose of Elaris. Her actions are mired in ambiguity, often seeming to undo one goal with the pursuit of the next. She maintains a sanctum, nestled deep within a grove where the fabric between worlds grows thin and the passing of time slows. Here she commands a domain suspended between life and decay, sustained by her mastery to draw vitality through the veil.

Elaris herself is an ever-changing entity, her form akin to the shifting winds and capricious seasons. Tall and graceful, she exudes an aura that is at once dark and imposing, and also bright and beguiling. Her eyes shimmer with a faint yellow light, and her voice resonates as if whispered directly into the listener's heart, an echo from a time long gone, when the world was young and magic was unknown.
