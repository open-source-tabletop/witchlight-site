Lysandra, an enigmatic figure revered among witches, obsessed with unraveling the elusive knowledge of the Eldren, ventured into the decaying heart of the Umbra, where the line between wisdom and madness blurred. Despite the threat of the relentless [Withering](/explore/witchcraft/the-withering/), her unyielding pursuit of forbidden truths led her to a discovery beyond reckoningâ€”the fabled Library concealed within towering mountains. Within its spectral halls, etched with the arcane revelations of a lost civilization, Lysandra abandoned mortal desires, forever bound to its eerie embrace.

Driven by a growing need for knowledge, Lysandra sacrificed all earthly pursuits to seek the deepest secrets of the fae and their tragic fate. Her transformation into an ethereal oracle was sealed by the discovery of the [Eldren](/explore/mythology/the-eldren/) rites of prophecy, giving her murky glimpses into the threads of the future. Witches now seek her spectral guidance, offering rituals and homage in exchange for glimpses into the enigmatic paths she weaves through time and destiny.

Amidst the secluded depths of the Library's twisting caverns, Lysandra exists as an eerie specter of her former self. Her pallid form and distant, milky eyes betray a detachment from mortal concerns, draped in threadbare robes adorned with patches of clinging moss. Crowned with delicate winter moonflowers amidst her long, dark grey hair, she embodies the haunting allure of forbidden knowledge, forever intertwined with the mysteries she unearthed in the hidden recesses of the Umbra.
