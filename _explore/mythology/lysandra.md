Venturing further into the decaying heart of the Umbra, weaving powerful spells to forestall the [Withering](/explore/witchcraft/the-withering/), she learned a great deal that had long been lost. Had she had much interest in the mortal world she could surely have shaped it to her will, but her mind was always on the pursuit of forbidden truth, until she discovered a store house of Eldren Knowledge carved deep into the rocks within caves high in imposing mountains. Within those hallowed spaces she found peace. and relief from the Withering, finally Lysandra abandoned mortal desires, forever bound to its eerie embrace.

Her pallid form and distant, milky eyes betray a detachment from mortal concerns, draped in threadbare robes adorned with patches of clinging moss. Crowned with delicate winter moonflowers amidst her long, dark grey hair, she embodies the haunting allure of forbidden knowledge, forever intertwined with the mysteries she unearthed in the hidden recesses of the Umbra.
