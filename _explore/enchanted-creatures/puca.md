Puca are small woodland sprites standing around the height of a child, with slender frames and pale green skin resembling young plants. They sport delicate wings like translucent leaves and heads adorned with petals or leaves that change with the seasons or emotions. Their large, expressive eyes shimmer like dewdrops, conveying deep emotion and wisdom.

These sprites wield profound influence over plant life, encouraging growth, blooms, and fruit. They can manipulate roots to ensnare intruders and blend seamlessly into nature, nearly disappearing. Puca also possess healing abilities, extending their aid to other creatures in need.

Regarded as heralds of spring, Puca are revered by humans who leave offerings in wild places hoping to gain their favour in their harvests. They also protect forests, punishing those who harm them. Initially wary of witches due to their curse, Puca will align with those who share their love for nature, forming alliances based on mutual respect and shared goals.
