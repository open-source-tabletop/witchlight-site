In the murk of the many swampy areas of the mortal realms there lurks a squat creature, typically standing around 4-5 feet, the Boglins. Their rough, warty skin blends seamlessly with the greens and browns of their boggy habitat, where they navigate with surprising agility through treacherous terrain. With toad-like faces adorned by bulbous eyes and wide mouths, Boglins possess a distinctive charm that reflects their mischievous yet endearing nature.

These amphibious beings effortlessly maneuver through labyrinthine waters and muddy paths, aided by an uncanny ability to traverse connected waterways, rumored to be linked through ethereal threads in the veil. They are renowned for their remarkable regenerative abilities, highly valued by witches of who enlist them as steadfast aides. Some Boglins can also excrete a potent toxin from their skin, providing both defense and a valuable substance for coating their rudimentary weapons.

Despite their reputation as mischief-makers, Boglins harbor a deep connection to their marshy homes and demonstrate unwavering loyalty to those they serve or protect. While they may appear slothful, they symbolize the cyclical nature of decay and renewal, embodying the slow rhythm of life's transformations. In their alliance with witches, Boglins thrive under the guidance of those who share a portion of their power. Blessed with a pragmatic simplicity, Boglins dutifully carry out tasks assigned to them, their loyalty secured by the steady hand of a witch's craft.
