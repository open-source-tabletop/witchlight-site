In ages past, the formidable witch [Morvaen](/explore/mythology/morvaen.html) discovered that her craft intertwined with the life force that permeated all living beings. Drawing upon this primal energy, she unwittingly became a scourge upon the natural world, compelling a rare assembly of witches to unite and bind her with a potent curse. While the curse worked, Morvaen's unparalleled power rebounded, casting a shadow that now taints all who wield magic.

Regardless of their intentions, all witches absorb the life essence of their surroundings. This slow drain causes plants to wither and animals to falter. Though history has obscured the details of Morvaen's demise, the devastation she wrought and the enduring curse has stained the collective memory of mortals. Unaware of its origin, humans instinctively fear and distrust witches, often reacting with hostility and condemnation. This fear has caused young witches to lives of exile, abandoned by their communities, and hated by their friends and families.

For some witches, the curse is a burden they manage through the power they find in the Umbra, using their magic to nurture life rather than deplete it. Others succumb to darker impulses, draining life to enforce their will upon the world around them, a grim echo of Morvaen's fateful choice.
