In the decaying realm of the [Umbra](/explore/locations/the-umbra/), where witches seek forbidden power and hidden truths, lies a perilous gamble. Though it brims with potent magic and arcane secrets, it exacts a toll on those who dare to linger. Witches, tethered to magic but not born of it, risk a descent into madness with every passing moment. Even a brief visit within its fae embrace can unravel the mind, blurring the line between reality and delusion. Only the strongest-willed can endure a day and night before the fabric of their sanity begins to tear.

Yet some witches find themselves ensnared, trapped by the withering decay. First, their focus wanes, memories blur, and their purpose slips into shadows. Escape becomes a distant hope, though rare souls return forever changed—haunted, their recollections twisted and ambitions distorted.

As time stretches onward, these lost souls grow further detached from their mortal selves. Nourished by raw magic alone, they forget mortal needs like food and drink. Their very bodies contort under the strain of their own sorcery, their desires twisted beyond recognition. Many devolve into twisted beings, prowling the shadowed wilds of the Umbra, while others meld seamlessly into the fabric of the realm itself.

Certain witches, driven by malice or ambition, strand rivals or even unwitting mortals within the Umbra's grasp. They return intermittently, relishing the suffering wrought by the relentless withering—a grim spectacle amid the twilight's dance.
