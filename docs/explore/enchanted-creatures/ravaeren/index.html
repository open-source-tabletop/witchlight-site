            <h1 class="title">Ravaeren</h1>
            <p>Ravaeren are majestic creatures resembling ravens or crows but larger, boasting a wingspan of up to 10 feet. Their feathers shimmer with silvery-black hues that change unnaturally in different lights, complemented by small curved horns and dual sets of eyes.</p>

<p>Gifted with extraordinary abilities, Ravaeren can briefly alter their size, shrinking to hide or enlarging to intimidate. They see into both the Mortal Realm and the Umbra, and can pass between these worlds at will. While Ravaeren do not truly speak they may carry messages through repeated mimics, though always subtly altering the information they bear.</p>

<p>Originally bound by the <a href="/explore/mythology/the-eldren/">Eldren</a> as guardians of the Veil, Ravaeren watch over vulnerable rifts, though few still uphold this ancient duty. They serve as omens of change and caution for witches, who view them as unpredictable allies and guides to realms beyond. To ally with a Ravaeren, a witch must earn its trust or discover its true name, as these creatures resist domination and can become mischievous or hostile if coerced. Itâ€™s whispered among witches that <a href="/explore/mythology/elaris/">Elaris</a> was guided into the Umbra by a Ravaeren, a companion that has since remained by her side, embodying the intricate bond between these creatures and witches.</p>
