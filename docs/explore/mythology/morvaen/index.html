            <h1 class="title">Morvaen The Devourer</h1>
            <p>Morvaen was an ancient witch that discovered her craft through the inate magic that resides in all living things. This abundant source of power caused her abilities to grow rapidly, and with them, her insatiable hunger for more. However, her relentless pursuit of power came at a dire cost. As she tapped into the life force around her, she withered and killed all living things in her vicinity, and this dark practice eventually twisted and corrupted her own form.</p>

<p>As Morvaen’s power surged, she became a dire threat to the Mortal world. Her presence brought death and decay, leaving barren lands in her wake. In desperation, the most powerful witches of the time formed a Coven—a rare and perilous assembly. They devised a binding curse to sever Morvaen from her source of power. Although the curse succeeded, Morvaen’s strength allowed her to twist the curse to her own malevolent ends, inadvertently binding all witches to its effects. This became known as the <a href="/explore/witchcraft/the-curse/">Curse of Morvaen</a>.</p>

<p>The Coven believed they had destroyed Morvaen when she vanished after the curse was cast. However, it was later discovered that she had not been completely eradicated. Morvaen’s spirit continued to cling to the Mortal world, lurking in the shadows, always hungering for power. During certain celestial events, she manifests again, preying on the living, her presence a chilling reminder of her once unstoppable force. Yet, no matter how much she devours, she can never maintain her form for more than a few fleeting hours.</p>
