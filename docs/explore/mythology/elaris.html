            <h1 class="title">Elaris, Mother of Witches</h1>
            <p>The most ancient tales of the early tribes weave stories of Elaris, an ethereal figure cloaked in mystery and revered as perhaps the first witch. Legends speak of her emergence from the depths of time, her origins obscured by the long passage of ages. For witches, the story of Elaris transcends the past; she is known to appear before young witches grappling with the tempestuous nature of their craft. To these souls, she extends guidance, a beckoning hand veiled in promise. But every boon she bestows exacts its price, often a burden too heavy for those who accept her aid.</p>

<p>Her motivations remain an enigma, woven with threads of inscrutable purpose. Some say she is driven by an insatiable thirst for arcane wisdom and the relentless pursuit of unearthly power. Her actions, veiled in ambiguity, reflect an intricate dance between mortal realms and the intangible weave of The Umbra. Within her sanctum, nestled deep within a grove where the fabric between worlds grows thin, Elaris commands a domain suspended between life and decay. Here, life flourishes in juxtaposition with creeping rot, sustained by her mastery to draw vitality through the veil.</p>

<p>Elaris herself is an ever-changing entity, her form akin to the shifting winds and capricious seasons. Tall and graceful, she exudes an aura that oscillates between dark and imposing, and bright and beguiling. Her eyes shimmer with a faint yellow light, and her voice resonates as if whispered directly into the listener’s soul—an echo from a time immemorial, when the world was young and magic was yet untamed.</p>
