            <h1 class="title">The Craft of Witches</h1>
            <p>The connection a witch has to the magic in the world is always very personal, and can manifest in a myriad of ways. That being said the most common forms of witchcraft can be broadly categorised into 5 different types, known as crafts.</p>

<h2 id="the-craft-of-the-wild-wind">The Craft of the Wild Wind</h2>

<p>For those that feel the essence of magic whispering through the breeze, growing up through the grass, and rushing through the water, the world seems in constant motion, a slight breeze ready to turn to a furious storm at any moment. Some are swept away in it, finding a use for the raw power they find, while others find they can tame it, direct it subtly to their ends without disturbing the natural flow around them.</p>

<h2 id="the-craft-of-blood-and-bone">The Craft of Blood and Bone</h2>

<p>The Craft of Blood and Bone calls out to those who grasp life’s harsh truths, not solely a path of darkness but rather a recognition of life’s delicate balance, its vulnerability woven with resilience. This connection that magic has to the life of all things can be manipulated, causing some to wither away while others are held at the brink of death. More than most, this craft leaves it’s mark upon the witch, corrupting them in ways that reflect the macabre nature of their gift.</p>

<h2 id="the-craft-of-veiled-vision">The Craft of Veiled Vision</h2>

<p>The world around us is only as real as our perception of it, you do not need to change the world when you can simply change the minds of those who experience it. It is of little effort for a witch to set their will to shaping the sight, the thoughts, and even feelings of those around them, but not all are so easily swayed from their course.</p>

<h2 id="the-craft-of-symbols-and-binding">The Craft of Symbols and Binding</h2>

<p>It is in the nature of humans to make things, to take the world around them and shape it to their needs. That there are many witches who discover the flow of magic around them only to take it, to shape it into talismans, to set their will and intention into runes, is then no surprise. Despite the mistrust all people have toward witches, it is witches of this craft which are most tolerated. For they can provide healing, protection, and blessings, without the need to tolerate the witches presence.</p>

<h2 id="the-wildsoul-craft">The Wildsoul Craft</h2>

<p>While every craft is unique, there are individuals whose souls resonate with the primal essence of magic itself. These Wildsouls find they have an innate connection to nature’s raw power, their spirits intertwined with the untamed forces of the land. For them, magic is thier bond with the world around them, allowing them to channel nature’s energy with instinctive grace rather than accumulate it within themselves. They wander the wilds, communing with spirits and drawing upon the earth’s essence, shaping it with their will and intent. Wildsoul magic is as unpredictable as the wind, as vibrant as the sunset, and as eternal as the cycle of life and death.</p>
