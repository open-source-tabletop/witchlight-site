            <p>While The Umbra is rich with power and contains hidden knowledge there is a risk to any witches that spend time there. While witches are connected to magic they are not creatures of magic. The same power the witches seek to harness will also slowly drive them insane. After even a few hours in the fae realm a witch can sense their mind wandering, their grip on what is real beginning to unravel. With a strong mind a witch can spend no more than a day and night there before risking serious harm.</p>

<p>Of course there are witches that find themselves lost, stuck in some way, and at the mercy of the withering. They first lose their focus and their memory becomes unreliable, they forget their purpose or remember it completely differently. Escape from the Umbra at this point is unlikely but some do come back, utterly changed, remaining distant, with twisted recollections and pursuits.</p>

<p>As more time passes the witch will become even more detached from their mortal existence. They will be sustained by the raw magic while forgetting to eat or drink. Their own craft will warp their form irrevocably and they will succumb to their most basic desires. Most become twisted creatures that stalk the wilds of the shadow realm, others become as one with the world around them and become a part of the world around them.</p>

<p>Some witches will deliberately strand rivals, or even mortals in the Umbra, returning occasionally to watch them suffer as the effects of the withering take hold.</p>
