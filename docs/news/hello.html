            <p>Hello and welcome to my new website, this new blog, for my new game. That’s a whole lot of ‘new’ so I think I should maybe do some introductions.</p>

<p>Chances are if you are on this website then it’s because of some social media post I’ve made, and we likely follow each other and have likely had a blether or two. If not then all you really need to know is that my name is Callie (she/her), I’m a Scottish artist, 3d sculptor, and tabletop game designer. Thanks to the 3 people who’ve bought my stuff I get to say those things and I appreciate you so much.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-exactly-is-witchlight">So what exactly is Witchlight?</h2>

<p>Witchlight is my new project, in fact it’s been on my mind for a while now but until recently I hadn’t felt I was in the right place to start because this one is a little different. Witchlight is the bringing together of so many things I love and care about, things I obsess about and want to create.</p>

<p>At it’s core Witchlight is a project to create a tabletop skirmish game that embraces individuality and expression. What makes this project so exciting for me is that it feels like the culmination of a lifetime of fascinations and interests - all of which I get to express in this game. World building, art, graphic design, writing, 3d modelling and printing, miniature painting, game design, terrain crafting, photographs, website design, programming, blogging…</p>

<p>I can’t wait to share more about this game, I hope it will find a home among players who are seeking something a little different, and I can’t wait to see what people make with it.</p>
